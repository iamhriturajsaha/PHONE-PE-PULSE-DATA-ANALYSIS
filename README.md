## 🧩 Project Structure

### 1. 📂 Data Extraction
- Cloned the [PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository](https://github.com/PhonePe/pulse).
- Extracted nested JSON files for transaction and user data.

### 2. 🧱 SQL Database Setup
Created and populated the following tables in SQLite:

#### Aggregated Tables
- `aggregated_transaction`
- `aggregated_user_summary`
- `aggregated_user_by_device`

#### Map Tables
- (Planned) State- and district-level map visualizations

#### Top Tables
- (Planned) Insights into top states, districts, pin codes by metrics

### 3. 🧮 Data Analysis
- Executed SQL queries to analyze transactions by:
  - Year, Quarter, State
  - Device brand, User engagement
- Python used for:
  - Data wrangling (`pandas`)
  - Visualizations (`seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `plotly`)

### 4. 📊 Dashboard with Streamlit
- Built an interactive web dashboard in Streamlit
- Hosted directly from Google Colab via `pyngrok`
